      <p>This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI
        community. The majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of feature
        requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A full list
        of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the <ref
          target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/milestone/16?closed=1">4.8.0 milestone</ref>. Very
        special thanks to Michael Beißwenger and Harald Lüngen for their essential contributions to
        the new computer-mediated communication chapter. Many thanks also to the community
        contributors who reported issues, sent bug fixes, and helped with the drafting that led
        to this release, including: John Bampton, Benjamin W. Bohl, Lou Burnard, Martin Holmes,
        Martin de la Iglesia, Jessica Lu, Dominique Meeùs, Kiyonori Nagasaki, Bastian Politycki,

      <p>The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: <list>
          <head>New encoding features</head>
          <item>A <ref target="https://tei-c.org/Vault/P5/4.8.0/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CMC.html">new
              chapter on computer-mediated communication (CMC)</ref> provides guidelines for
            structuring texts and corpora in TEI that encode the data and metadata of interactive
            posts from various media platforms (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1955">#1955</ref> and <ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2537">PR #2537</ref>). The chapter introduces
            a new <gi>post</gi> element to encode a contribution to a CMC interaction, and with it: <list>
              <item>two new attribute classes <name type="class">att.cmc</name> and <name
                  type="class">att.indentation</name>, of which <gi>post</gi> is a member.</item>
              <item>The following new attributes are specific to <gi>post</gi>: <list>
                  <item><att>modality</att> to document whether a post is written or spoken,</item>
                  <item><att>replyTo</att> to indicate a previous post to which a post replies or
                    refers,</item>
                  <item><att>generatedBy</att> (a member of <name type="class">att.cmc</name>) with
                    suggested values <val>human</val>, <val>template</val>, <val>system</val>,
                      <val>bot</val>, and <val>unspecified</val> to indicate how content in a post
                    is generated.</item>
                </list></item>
              <item>The <gi>post</gi> element is also a member of <name type="class"
                  >att.global</name>, <name type="class">att.ascribed</name>, <name type="class"
                  >att.datable</name>, <name type="class">att.timed</name>, <name type="class"
                  >att.fragmentable</name>, <name type="class">att.docStatus</name>, <name
                  type="class">att.typed</name>, and <name type="class">att.canonical</name> giving
                it access to many attributes to identify agents responsible for posts, indicate
                their timing, and categorize them.</item>
              <item>A new attribute, <att>indentLevel</att>, is not restricted to CMC but provided
                in the class <name type="class">att.indentation</name> to describe indentation of
                text content in a source, for example to mark a post’s level of indentation in a
                discussion thread.</item>

        <list>
          <head>Changes to content models</head>
          <item>With this release, <gi>quote</gi> is now a member of <name type="class"
              >model.biblPart</name>, permitting it to be used within <gi>bibl</gi> (<ref

              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2557">PR #2557</ref>).</item>
          <item>The Guidelines now deprecate the use of <gi>superEntry</gi> and <gi>re</gi> elements
            as superfluous since the <gi>entry</gi> element may now self-nest (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2488">#2488</ref>, <ref

              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/pull/2521">#2521</ref>).</item>
          <item>The <gi>event</gi> element is now more efficiently modeled using <name type="class"
              >model.eventLike</name> with no changes to its content. (<ref
              target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2524">#2524</ref> and <ref

          <item>To improve gaiji descriptions, the <att>scheme</att> attribute was added to <name
              type="class">att.gaijiProp</name>, and <gi>mapping</gi>, <gi>localProp</gi>
            <gi>unicodeProp</gi>, and <gi>unihanProp</gi> were added to <name type="class"

            #2511</ref>).</item>
          <item>The datatype <name type="datatype">teidata.probability</name> was previously defined
            too broadly as <code>xsd:double</code>, and has now been constrained to a value between
            0 and 1 (<ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/2518">#2518</ref> and <ref

      <p>The following changes introduced with this release could invalidate ODD customizations in
        TEI projects. Those maintaining ODD customizations of the TEI should be aware of the
        following changes, and may need to adapt their ODD files accordingly. <list>
          <head>ODD-breaking changes and deprecation</head>
          <item>Following a deprecation period that has now ended, the <gi>content</gi> element,
            which declares the content model of an element being specified in an ODD, now requires
            exactly one and only one child element. If several RELAX NG elements are desired, they
            must now be wrapped in an <gi scheme="RELAX_NG">rng:div</gi> (<ref

          <item>In order to avoid ambiguity, Schematron constraints in ODDs must now include an
              <gi scheme="Schematron">sch:rule</gi> element with a <att>context</att> attribute, and the
            Guidelines have been updated to reflect this change (<ref

          <item>For Guidelines processing, we have removed unnecessary <att>mode</att> attributes

      <p>In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide
        processing of TEI ODD files for <ref target="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/">Roma</ref> and
          <ref target="https://teigarage.tei-c.org/">TEIGarage</ref> as well as other TEI
        conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at <ref
          target="https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets">https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets</ref>. A
